# Plugin

This plugin repository is a revamp of the [original geolocation plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-plugins/tree/main/geolocation), and the official plugin since [version 7.1.0](/CHANGELOG.md). 

The plugin uses native libraries for accessing location in mobile. These libraries are housed in separate repositories:

- [ion-android-geolocation](https://github.com/ionic-team/ion-android-geolocation)
- [ion-ios-geolocation](https://github.com/ionic-team/ion-ios-geolocation)

## Usage
